**Conway's Game of Life**, also known as the  **Game of Life**  or simply  **Life**, is a  [cellular automaton](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Cellular_automaton "Cellular automaton")  devised by the British mathematician  [John Horton Conway](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/John_Horton_Conway "John Horton Conway")  in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## P.S.
Project have been done for [Svelte's](https://svelte.dev/https://svelte.dev/) features demonstration.
App has performance limitations because our playing field is array of **div-cells**. Sure that **canvas** would work better in that case but I preferred grid with divs because of I don't like to work with **canvas** üë∫.

Also there were configured [Github Workflow](https://github.com/features/actions) for üì¶CI/CDüöö  to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
